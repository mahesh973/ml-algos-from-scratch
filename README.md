# ML Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to the `ml-algos-from-scratch` repository! This repository contains implementations of widely used machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The main goal is to understand the inner workings of these algorithms.

## About

Machine learning algorithms are often used as black boxes, with the inner workings hidden behind libraries and frameworks. This project aims to demystify these algorithms by implementing them from scratch. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of how they work and how to optimize them.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- AdaBoost
- k-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Naive Bayes
- Perceptron

## Installation

To get started, you can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
